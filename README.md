# NetflixAnimation
Hey there, fellow developers! Welcome to the README file for the "Netflix Loading Intro" project using good ol' HTML and slick CSS. 
If you've ever been mesmerized by Netflix's iconic loading animation and thought, "Hey, I wanna create that magic too!" ‚Äì well, you're in the right place. 
In this project, we've whipped up a simple and fun recreation of the Netflix loading intro that you can easily integrate into your own web projects. 
All you need to do is grab the HTML and CSS files from our repository, tweak them to fit your vibe, and voil√† ‚Äì you'll have your users waiting in style. 
Feel free to customize and experiment, and don't forget to pop some popcorn while your code is loading! Happy coding and loading! üçøüöÄ
